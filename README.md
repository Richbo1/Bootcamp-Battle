## Description
Bootcamp Battle is a basic Phaser 3 HTML5 game that stores game data in a JawsDB server. When the "Start Game" button is 
clicked, a Sequelize game object is created, along with an enemy object. The player can move around the game area and shoot at
the enemy that is shown. When the enemy is killed, data will be sent to the server to reflect that.
